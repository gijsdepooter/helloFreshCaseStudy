# Recipes ETL

This script extracts recipes containing "Chilies" as one of the ingredients, adds a difficulty field based on prep and cook time, and saves the resulting dataset as a CSV file.

## How to run the script

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher is recommended).
2. Place the input JSON file named 'recipes.json' in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script from the command line or terminal using the following command: python your_script_name.py
4. The script will generate a CSV file named 'chilies_recipes.csv' in the same directory.
